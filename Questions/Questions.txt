Question 1 : FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are mulitples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Question 2 : Sum of Array Elements

Write a function sumArray(arr) that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the elements. Use a loop to iterate through the array and sum the numbers.

Question 3: Remove Duplicates

Write a function removeDuplicates(arr) that takes an array and returns a new array with duplicate elements removed. Use loops and conditionals to check for duplicates.

Question 4: Find the Maximum number

Write a function findMax(arr) that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. Use a loop to iterate through the array and a conditional to keep track of the maximum value.

Question 5: Count Vowels

Write a function countVowels(str) that takes a string and returns the number of vowels (a,e,i,o,u) in the string. Use a loop to iterate through the string and a conditional to check if each character is a vowel.

Question 6: Reverse an Array.

Write a function reverseArray(arr) that takes an array and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order. Use a loop to iterate through the array from the end of the beginning.

Question 7: Palindrome Checker

Write a function isPalindrome(str) that takes a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome (it reads the same forward and backward) and false otherwise. Use a loop to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string.

Question 8: Average of Array

Write a function averageArray(arr) that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of the elements. Use a loop to calculate the sum of the elements and then divide by the number of elements.

Question 9: Merge and Sort Arrays

Write a function mergeAndSort(arr1,arr2) that takes two arrays, merges them into one array, and returns the merged array sorted in ascending order. Use array methods and loops as needed. 

Question 10: Find Common Elements

Write a function commonElements(arr1,arr2) that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing the common elements between the two arrays. Use loops and conditionals to find and store the common elements.
